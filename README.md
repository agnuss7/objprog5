# Unit-testing

Bandžiau Catch. Nelabai buvo ką testuot, tik dvi funkcijos.

# Coolish things

Asociatyvūs konteineriai, jei jie nėra multi, neturi vienodų elementų. Dėl to naudojau ir std::set, ir std::multimap.
Multimap'o equal_range metodas įdomus, nes grąžina std::pair<iterator,iterator>.

            ret = a.equal_range(*f);
            for (std::multimap<std::string,int>::iterator it=ret.first; it!=ret.second; ++it)
            {
                cout <<", "<< it->second;
            }

Skaitymas po vieną simbolį normaliai išeina viską nuskaityt. eof() man niekada gerai neveikdavo.

    while(df.get(c))
    {
        if(isalpha(c))
        {
            if(isupper(c))
            {
                c=tolower(c);
            }
            w.push_back(c);
        }
    }
